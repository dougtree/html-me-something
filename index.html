      <p>Pallet skirts are designed to wrap around the bottom portion of a pallet display. Typically, within the club environment, they cover the stacked wooden pallets that lift product off of the sales floor. Utilizing pallet skirts is a way to manage product inventory, effectively reducing the inventory risk of products whose volume does not require a full pallet display. Successful pallet skirts communicate the identity of the brand, product, and its recognition with shoppers. They can evoke emotion through lifestyle imagery, powerful brand messaging, as well as educate the shopper more about the product.</p>

      <p>Sidekicks are smaller displays constructed to rest upon the sides of an endcap or fixture. Most sidekicks ship pre-packaged for rapid setup. Retailers typically include permanent endcap hardware enabling compatibility with those pre-packaged. Some sidekicks will ship with a temporary base that allows retailers to use the display as a floor stand. This is often referred to as a Power Wing. <br/>Floorstands, sometimes referred to as floor displays, are stand-alone merchandisers designed to rest directly on the retail floor. These may contain product and/or the branding message. Floorstands that only display a branding message are often referred to as monoliths. These typically display no product and are designed to quickly and easily display information in the foyer of a retail setting.</p>
